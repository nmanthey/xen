This directory contains the required files to reproduce the analysis of Xen for
XSAs with the help of CBMC and the abstract slicer.

## Requirements

Working docker setup. Machine with 8GB RAM (for this demo). For analysis with
more depth, unwinding, or less slicing, more memory is recommended.

## Quick Start

The following script compiles all tools, as well as Xen for the analysis, and
runs one example analysis:

./run-full-example.sh


## Step by Step

### Docker

As compiling Xen and CBMC requires dependencies, we add a Dockerfile that can be
used to compile the tools and run the analysis. The additional script allows to
execute commands as the calling user, but with the container system. This setup
allows to consume the file created in the container outside the container as
well.

docker/Dockerfile ............ Docker file with dependencies to build Xen and
                               CBMC
docker/run_in_container.sh ... Script to execute commands inside a docker
                               container with the ID of the calling user.

### Scripts to Build and Analyze

To build CBMC and Xen, run this script:

./build.sh

To run an analysis on Xen, the following script can be used as an entry point,
as it provides all the relevant steps to be executed, i.e. linking the harness,
slicing, and running the analysis.

./execute-single-run.sh
